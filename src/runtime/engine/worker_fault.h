// Verification seam for the worker's failure recovery (engine-architecture §7.4). A host-side
// worker failure is a defect, and once a defect is fixed no public input reaches it any more, so
// the recovery contract cannot be exercised through the public API alone. Arming N failures makes
// the next N prefill units throw after the Program has executed them, so each recovery releases a
// lane that holds live KV pages and state. The injected failure is an invariant failure
// (std::logic_error), which the worker recovers from under EngineOptions::recover_invariant_failures
// and latches on otherwise. Disarmed, the cost is one relaxed atomic load per prefill unit.
