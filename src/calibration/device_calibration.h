// Device calibration: measures every route family a device profile can steer on the current GPU
// (the route catalog, calibration/route_catalog.h) and returns, for each key it measured, the
// bands of the schedule that won: a candidate where one beat the compiled route, the compiled
// route (an empty schedule) elsewhere.
//
// Each family is timed through the same dispatch an inference call uses, with the family's route
// forced to one candidate at a time (ops::DeviceRouteForce), on synthetic weights of the registered
// model shapes and with L2 flushed before every sample. A candidate replaces the compiled choice
// only where it is faster by more than `margin`, so a profile records measured wins rather than
// noise.
