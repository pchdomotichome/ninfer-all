// Disk-resident experts: they stay in the artifact's files and a device pool of slots holds the
// ones passes route to. Before a layer's experts run, prepare() makes every expert the layer's
// tokens routed to resident: the slots of the least recently used experts (never one the same call
// needs) take the missing ones, read from the files through the OS page cache into a page-locked
// staging ring (several reads in flight at once) and copied on the layer's stream, and the layer's
// expert tables are pointed at them.
// The host memory this mode needs is the staging ring; the page cache keeps what the system can
// spare.
