// The forward pass of Qwen3.8-Flash-Next over a loaded Model: the four-stream residual stack in
// FP32, Gated DeltaNet and sparse-attention mixers, the PLE n-gram injection and the 512-expert
// MoE, layer by layer on each layer's stage device, the stack crossing to the next device at a
// stage boundary. The executor owns every sequence's mutable state (recurrent and convolution
// states, paged KV, the indexer's pooled keys, the PLE history and n-gram context) and the
// workspace; the model stays immutable.
