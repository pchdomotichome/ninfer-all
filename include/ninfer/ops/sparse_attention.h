 * Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's sparse attention for one sequence: query p attends only to the 4-token
 * blocks its indexer selected (qsa_indexer_select) and to its own incomplete block, positions
 * 4 floor((p + 1) / 4) .. p:
 *
 *   out[h] = sum_{j in S_p} softmax_j(scale * q[h] . k[kv(h), j]) v[kv(h), j],   kv(h) = h / 12
 *
 * `q` is BF16 [256, 24, tokens] (normalised and rotated) for the consecutive positions
 * `first_position` .., read from a device I32 word so that a call captured in a graph replays at
 * whatever position the word holds; `selected` I32 [512, tokens] and `counts` I32 [tokens] are the
 * indexer's blocks; `cache` is the sequence's BF16 paged KV layer (2 heads of 256) holding every
 * selected and tail position, its block table covering every position the caller reaches; `out`
 * is BF16 [256, 24, tokens]. The oracle evaluates the softmax and the weighted sum in FP64 from
 * the represented cache and queries; the output is compared after its BF16 store. Up to eight
 * queries keep partial softmaxes in FP32 workspace; no state.
